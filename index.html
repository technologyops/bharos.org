            <h1>Reclaim Digital Sovereignty</h1>
            <img src="20250907.jpg" alt="Digital Sovereignty">

            <p>We stand at digital crossroads. The internet has connected humanity, but our dependence on a handful of big-tech corporations has created an existential vulnerability. Artificial intelligence is accelerating this risk at an unprecedented pace.</p>

            <p>AI assistants aren't just tools; they are pervasive agents embedded into our lives - reading messages, tracking locations, managing finances, shaping preferences - and acting beyond our awareness.</p>

            <p>Our digital lives rest on three foundational layers: <b>hardware, operating system (OS), and applications (apps)</b>. Governments have tried to regulate hardware and apps, but they have overlooked the most vital gatekeeper - the Operating System.</p>

            <p>If AI is society's brain, then the OS is its spinal cord - the channel through which every signal and decision flows. Whoever controls it, controls us. History shows such dominance enables surveillance, manipulation, and even disruption during geopolitical conflict.</p>

            <h2>The "Ownership" Illusion</h2>

            <p>What we think of as ownership is, in reality, a carefully designed illusion. We pay for devices, but cannot freely decide what runs on them. Through the operating system, manufacturers and platform owners constrain what we can do, dictating which software we may or may not use.</p>

            <p>We should be able to run whatever code we choose on hardware we paid for. Our laws must make this possible. Without it, ownership remains a hollow promise.</p>

            <h2>"Open Source" is a dangerous misconception</h2>

            <p>What appears open, is often dependency by design.</p>

            <p>While Android/Linux/iOS are nominally open source, manufacturers must bundle proprietary software to remain viable in the market. These hidden locks ensure big tech retains the master keys.</p>

            <p>If we fail to act, our digital future will remain in foreign hands. The time for digital autonomy is now.</p>

            <h2>The Path to Digital Sovereignty:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Anchor AI in sovereignty: ensure intelligent systems run on self-governed OS foundations, not corporate black boxes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Guarantee True Ownership by Law: Require manufacturers to provide the technical documentation and rights needed to run any software on the hardware you own.</p></li>
                <li><p>Enforce cryptographic trust: Deploy join threshold cryptography so no single entity can dominate.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mandate modularity: Legally separate hardware, OS, and apps to end forced bundling.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Digital sovereignty is not resistance, it is resilience. Imagine an internet, where your device answers only to you.</p>

            <p>Reclaiming the OS is reclaiming our future - an internet where trust is mathematical, agency is restored to the user, and technology serves humanity.</p>
