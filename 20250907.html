    <p>The Internet has connected humanity... But, our dependence on a handful of big-tech corporations has created an existential vulnerability.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is accelerating this risk. AI isn’t just a tool — it is embedded in our lives: reading messages, tracking locations, shaping preferences, even acting without our awareness.</p>

    <p>If AI is society's brain, then the Operating System (OS) is its spinal cord - the channel through which every signal and decision flows. Whoever controls it, controls us.</p>

    <h2>The hidden Gatekeeper</h2>
    <p>Our digital lives are built on three layers: hardware, OS, and apps. Governments have tried to regulate hardware and apps, but overlooked the most powerful layer - the OS.</p>

    <p>This invisible layer of control is where the true power lies. While apps come and go and hardware evolves, it is the operating system that ultimately decides what runs, what is blocked, and who holds the keys.</p>

    <p>History shows such dominance enables surveillance, manipulation, and even disruption during geopolitical conflict.</p>

    <h2>Open Source misconception</h2>

    <p>What appears open, is often dependency by design.</p>

    <p>While Android/Linux are nominally open source, manufacturers must bundle proprietary software to remain viable in the market. These hidden locks ensure big tech retains the keys.</p>

    <h2>The Ownership illusion</h2>

    <p>We pay for devices, but cannot freely decide what runs on them. Through the operating system, manufacturers and platform owners constrain what we can do, dictating which software we may or may not use.</p>

    <p>True sovereignty means: we run what we choose on hardware we own. If we fail to act now, our digital future will continue to remain in foreign hands.</p>

    <h2>Path to Digital Sovereignty:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Mandate modularity: Legally separate hardware, OS, and apps to end forced bundling.</p></li>
      <li><p>Guarantee True Ownership by Law: Require manufacturers to provide the technical documentation and rights needed to run any software on the purchased hardware.</p></li>
      <li><p>Enforce cryptographic trust: Deploy threshold cryptography so no single entity can dominate.</p></li>
      <li><p>Anchor AI in sovereignty: ensure intelligent systems run on self-governed OS foundations, not corporate black boxes.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p>Digital sovereignty is not resistance, it is resilience.</p>
    <p>Imagine an internet, where your device answers only to you.</p>
    <p>Reclaim the OS. Reclaim our future.</p>
